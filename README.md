# Landing Page

This repository holds a web page based on a given design.

I decided to stick very close to the designs because (in my opinion) it is crucial to preserve the artistic intent of whoever spent the time designing these templates. Additionally, if this was produced by a strict client, I would be confident that they would be please with the result.
